## Analysis Methodology

### Git Blame Process

For each vulnerability identified in the security audit:
1. Use `git blame -L [start_line],[end_line] [file_path] --line-porcelain` to identify the commit that introduced the vulnerable code
2. Extract commit SHA, author name, author email, and commit date
3. Use `git log --format=fuller [commit_sha]` to find the committer and potential reviewers
4. If available, use GitHub API or git notes to identify the PR reviewer who approved the code

### Attribution Criteria

- **Committed by:** The developer who wrote and committed the vulnerable code (from git blame)
- **Approved by:** The reviewer who approved the PR containing the vulnerable code (from PR merge commit or GitHub API)

### Limitations

- Git blame shows the most recent change to a line, which may not be the original introduction of the vulnerability
- PR reviewers may not be available in git history if PRs were squash-merged or if GitHub metadata is not accessible
- Some vulnerabilities may span multiple commits or files, requiring manual attribution
- Automated commits (e.g., dependabot, CI bots) are excluded from attribution
