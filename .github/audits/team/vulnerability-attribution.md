# Vulnerability Attribution Assessment

<!-- analysis: git-history -->

## Assessment Period
**Audit Date:** [AUDIT_DATE]  
**Team:** [TEAM_NAME]  
**Assessor:** [ASSESSOR]  
**Date Completed:** [COMPLETION_DATE]

---

## Executive Summary

**Purpose:** Identify which team members are responsible for security vulnerabilities found in the codebase using git blame analysis.

**Key Findings:**
- Total vulnerabilities analyzed: [NUMBER]
- Total developers attributed: [NUMBER]
- Most affected areas: [AREAS]

---

## Assessment Methodology

### Data Collection

This assessment correlates security findings with git history to determine responsibility:

```bash
# For each vulnerable file and line range, run git blame
git blame -L [start_line],[end_line] [file_path] --line-porcelain

# Get commit details
git show [commit_sha] --format="%H|%an|%ae|%ad|%s" --date=iso --no-patch

# Get author's total commit count
git log --author="[email]" --all --oneline | wc -l
```

### Attribution Process

1. **Extract Vulnerabilities** - Read all security audit findings from `security/*.md`
2. **Locate Code** - Identify file paths and line numbers for each vulnerability
3. **Run Git Blame** - Determine the last author to modify the vulnerable code
4. **Aggregate Results** - Group vulnerabilities by author
5. **Context Analysis** - Review commit messages and timing

---

## Quality Control Checklist

- [ ] Read all security audit templates
- [ ] Extracted vulnerabilities with file locations
- [ ] Ran git blame for each vulnerable code section
- [ ] Verified file paths exist in repository
- [ ] Excluded vendor/generated code from attribution
- [ ] Documented commit SHAs for evidence
- [ ] Noted any ambiguous attributions

## Evidence Repository

### Example Git Blame Output

# Example for authentication.js:45-52
$ git blame -L 45,52 src/auth/authentication.js --line-porcelain

commit a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0
author John Developer
author-mail <john@example.com>
author-time 1634567890
author-tz -0700
committer John Developer
committer-mail <john@example.com>
committer-time 1634567890
committer-tz -0700
summary feat(auth): add JWT token validation
filename src/auth/authentication.js
        // Vulnerable code: No token expiration check
```

## Limitations and Caveats

### Attribution Limitations

- **Git Blame Limitations:** Shows last modifier, not original author
- **Refactoring Impact:** Code moved/refactored may attribute to wrong developer
- **Inherited Code:** Pre-repository or third-party code may lack attribution
- **Pair Programming:** Git history shows only one author
- **Automated Changes:** Bots/tools may mask human responsibility

### Interpretation Guidelines

- **Context Matters:** Attribution ≠ blame; code may have been correct when written
- **Security Knowledge:** Not all developers have equal security training
- **Time Factor:** Older vulnerabilities may reflect outdated best practices
- **Review Process:** Responsibility may be shared with reviewers who approved
- **Business Pressure:** Deadlines may have forced shortcuts

---

## Follow-Up Actions

- [ ] Share findings with development team
- [ ] Schedule security training sessions
- [ ] Update security review checklist
- [ ] Implement recommended tooling
- [ ] Plan refactoring for high-risk areas
- [ ] Schedule 1-on-1s with developers (as needed)
- [ ] Re-audit after remediation (timeline: [DATE])
