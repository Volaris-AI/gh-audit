## Assessment Methodology

### Data Collection

This assessment aggregates vulnerability data from all security audit templates:

1. **Extract Vulnerability Attribution** - Read all security templates and extract:
   - "Committed By" field (developer who wrote the vulnerable code)
   - "Approved By" field (reviewer(s) who approved the PR)

2. **Aggregate by Developer** - Count vulnerabilities for each developer in two categories:
   - Vulnerabilities committed (wrote the code)
   - Vulnerabilities approved (reviewed and approved the PR)

3. **Analyze Patterns** - Identify training needs and systemic issues

---

## Notes

[Any additional context, observations, or notes]

**Data Source:** Security audit templates in `audits/YYYY-MM-DD/security/*.md`

**Methodology Note:** Statistics are based on "Committed By" and "Approved By" fields in security templates. Attribution is done via git blame (last modifier) and PR review history. See individual security templates for specific vulnerability details.

## Metadata

**Total Vulnerabilities Analyzed:** [NUMBER]  
**Total Developers Involved:** [NUMBER]  
**Security Templates Reviewed:** [NUMBER]  
**Analysis Duration:** [TIME]
